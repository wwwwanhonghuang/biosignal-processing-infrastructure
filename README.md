# Bio-Signal Processing Infrastructure

A unified, extensible framework for designing and implementing both practical and experimental bio-signal preprocessing pipelines. This infrastructure supports research and application by integrating multiple computational paradigms.

## Integrated Methodologies

The framework incorporates several complementary approaches:

*   **Traditional Signal Processing**: Digital filters (FIR, IIR), spectral analysis, template matching.
*   **Dynamical Systems & Nonlinear Methods**: Phase space reconstruction, attractor analysis, recurrence quantification.
*   **Neural Network Models**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for bio-plausible processing and standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
*   **Theoretical & Mathematical Physics**: Techniques from group field theory and statistical physics.
*   **Geometric & Topological Methods**: For analyzing the structure of high-dimensional signal manifolds.
